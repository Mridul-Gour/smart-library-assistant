# 📚 Smart Library Assistant - Log Rotation Script

## 📝 Description

This project includes a **Windows Batch Script** that performs **log rotation and compression** for the application logs generated by the Smart Library Assistant project.

The script works with the following log files located inside the `/logs` folder:

- `log.txt`  
- `log.log`

It is designed to help in **maintaining clean logs by:**

- Archiving old logs with date-based filenames
- Compressing them into `.zip` files
- Deleting logs older than 30 days
